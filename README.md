This is a web based tender management application for universities

# Tender Management Web Application (MERN STACK)
## Overview

University Tender Management System is a cloud-based web application designed to streamline the tendering process within universities. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this platform provides an intuitive and efficient interface for managing tender announcements, bid submissions, evaluations, and approvals.

The system caters to university administrators, vendors, and procurement officers, ensuring a transparent and organized tendering process. With role-based access, real-time notifications, and secure document management, the application enhances efficiency, compliance, and collaboration in university procurement.
## Why/Problem ?

In many universities, including Dedan Kimathi University, the tendering process is often managed through manual documents, physical paperwork, and spreadsheets. This traditional approach presents several challenges, such as:
+ Inefficiency - Managing tenders manually is time-consuming and prone to delays.
+ Lack of Transparency – Paper-based systems make it difficult to track tender progress and ensure fair bidding.
+ Data Loss & Security Risks – Physical documents can be misplaced, damaged, or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
+ Limited Accessibility – Vendors and university officials must be physically present to submit or review documents, reducing flexibility.
+ Error-Prone Processes – Manual data entry increases the risk of miscalculations, missing deadlines, and inconsistencies.

The University Tender Management System aims to solve these issues by digitizing the entire tendering process, ensuring efficiency, security, and transparency while reducing administrative overhead.
## Background

Traditional tendering in universities has relied on manual processes, requiring physical document submissions that lead to inefficiencies, delays, and transparency issues. Some institutions have adopted email-based or basic web forms for tender management, but these lack essential features such as real-time tracking, automated notifications, and secure evaluations.

A modern digital tender management system is necessary to streamline workflows, enhance accessibility, and improve transparency. By leveraging technology, a dedicated platform can centralize tender processes, making them more efficient, secure, and accessible for all stakeholders.
